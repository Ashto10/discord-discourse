Discord Discourse
=================

Originally meant to be [a simple html assignment](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) about properly setting up a form, yet here we are. Currently files away the user's opinions right where they belong, but will shortly gather some much needed information for our private Discord channel when I have the necessary input.

The garbage can is here to stay, however.
